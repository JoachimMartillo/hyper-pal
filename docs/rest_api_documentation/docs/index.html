						The Assets API allows you to interact with our system programmatically from your own application. Using the API you interact with Resources such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Record</li>
						<li>Classification, RecordClassification</li>
						<li>Field, FieldDefinition</li>
						<li>File, FileVersion, FilePreview, AdditionalFile</li>
						<li>Image, Watermark</li>
						<li>Language</li>
						<li>MaintenanceJob</li>
						<li>etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The API follows some aspects of hypermedia-driven web APIs, like using linked/embedded resources in the returned resource representation.
						Each resource can be accessed directly through its URI but it can also be accessed as an embedded sub-resource in its parent resource,
						like collection resource for example.
					</p>
					<p>
						To read a resource, a standard HTTP GET request is used. The request can include some optional parameters which allow you to
						control how much of the information should be included/excluded in the returned resource, depending on how much information is needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						To update a resource, a standard HTTP PUT request is used. Here, you can also specify the amount of data to be changed in the resource
						by not specifying in your request those resource properties which you don't want to change. Only the values of resource properties, which
						are specified in your request, are changed/updated.
					</p>
					<p>
						To create a new resource, a standard HTTP POST request is performed on the appropriate collection of such resources. For example, if you
						would like to create a new record, you would perform an HTTP POST request on a record collection. If you don't specify some of the optional
						resource properties in your request, the default values will be used.
					</p>
					<p>
						To delete a resource, a standard HTTP DELETE request is used. Based on your access rights, you might be denied the request to delete
						a resource.
					</p>

				<h3 id="gettingstarted_setup">REST API configuration</h3>
				<div class="collapsable">
					<p>
						After deployment of the ADAM REST API, you should also configure the ADAM structures that are used by the REST API.
					</p>
					<p>
						This configuration will, among other things, create a <code>.rest_SettingsWhitelist</code> system setting. If you want to work
						with ADAM settings via the REST API, this setting should be provisioned by an ADAM administrator, as described in <a href="resources/setting.html">the setting resource documentation</a>.
					</p>
					<p>To do the configuration:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="#usage_authentication">Authenticate</a>, using the credentials of an ADAM administrator account on the ADAM registration that you want to initialize, and use the <a href="#usage_authentication_token">token</a> to connect to the setup endpoint.</li>
						<li>Perform an HTTP POST request on the <b>/setup</b> endpoint. This POST request should have an empty body.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						<b>Note</b>: If you have more than one ADAM registration, you have to repeat this request for each of the ADAM registrations.
					</p>
					<pre>
POST /setup HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA==
API-VERSION: 1
</pre>
					<p>
						The command above will upgrade your REST API system structures to the up-to-date state. However, such upgrade depends on other components of the system and previous upgrades.
						You may face a situation when configuration call passes successfully, but there is still an issue e.g. when uploading files. If you see such issues, these are the possible
						actions to fix them:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>First, try rebuilding an Enterprise Search index and/or ensure synchronization is started. Consult ADAM Administrator Guide on how to do this.</li>
						<li>
							If step 1 doesn't solve the issue, you can try to repair your REST API structures by performing a forced configuration call. It differes from regular
							configuration call by an added request body containing a <code>forceRebuild</code> flag. Of course, you should also add the <code>content-type</code> header.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						<b>Note</b>: this form of configuration request is an emergency action that is not normally needed. All the missing items needed by REST API will be recreated.
						This means that as the result of this command you may get useless objects in your system if you previously renamed them manually.
					</p>

				<h3 id="gettingstarted_navigation">Navigating the API</h3>
				<div class="collapsable">
					<p>
						The ADAM REST API supports two different ways of consuming and navigating the API:
					</p>
					<h4>HAL/JSON hypermedia</h4>
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>
						Once a resource is retrieved, your client can bookmark the URI in its cache.
						<!--Keep in mind though that resource URI's in a HAL/JSON API are not permanent and can change over time, so if you implement client-side caching, validate and refresh your bookmarks if necessary.-->
						The existing relation names will not change over time, but new relations can be introduced.
					</p>
					<p>
						Links in the returned resource representation help you to navigate the API, just by following those links. Using this approach helps
						create API clients/servers that do not depend too much on each other and can be developed in an independent way, as long as both the
						client and the server have a common understanding of media types used in the communication. For example, you can start using the API
						by going to the root URI of the API and discover all the resources you can access.
						From that point on, you can follow links and explore the resources existing throughout the API. You can use the "select" keys,
						present in most of the resources, which provide you with information about which sub-resources can be embedded in that resource.
						This way you can retrieve the exact information needed in a single request, which helps you optimize the
						chattiness of the API for your specific use case.
					</p>
					<h4>Plain JSON consumption</h4>
					<p>
						Next to using the HAL/JSON hypermedia API, clients can also consume the API using plain JSON. This is a simpler but less robust approach,
						since it lacks discoverability and requires upfront knowledge of the URI's for all the endpoints that the client will need. For pure JSON clients,
						we provide an exhaustive <a href="endpoints.html">list of the endpoints</a> available in the API.

				<h3 id="gettingstarted_version">Current version</h3>
				<div class="collapsable">
					<p>
						A required request header parameter, which specifies which version of the API the request will refer to:
					</p>
					<pre>API-Version: 1</pre>
					<p>
						There are some exceptions to this requirement, like the root resource and the "supported versions" resource.
						These resources are version-agnostic, meaning they will always display the same result, no matter which
						"API-Version" parameter has been specified (if any). Also, they will never change what exists, but can add new information to ensure backwards-compatibility.
						The reason for this exception is a requirement to provide consumers with a way to discover the list of existing and supported API versions before they
						start using it. If these resources were also version-aware, consumers wouldn't have a way to discover the
						proper values that can be specified in the "API-Version" parameter.

			<section class="block block--details">
				<h3 id="concepts_selecting">Selecting</h3>
				<div class="collapsable">
					<p>
						The selecting feature is used in the ADAM REST API to support the dynamic nature of the ADAM resources
						and to provide the API consumers with a way to select a custom granularity level for the resource
						representation they want to retrieve from ADAM. It helps consumers retrieve more information
						using a single request.
					</p>
					<p>
						By default, when a resource is requested, it is usually returned using a minimal representation,
						which contains as little data as possible (for example, all of the sub-resources of the requested
						resource are not returned in this minimal representation). If needed, a consumer can extend this
						resource representation by selecting more data to be included, using the "select" header parameter.
					</p>
					<p>
						The general format of the select parameter is:
						<code>"Select-{Resource}: SubResource1,SubResource2,SubResource3, ..."</code>
						where the value is a comma-separated list of subresources to be included in the resulting resource
						representation. It specifies that the returned resource's representation also contain its
						subresources, beside the basic/minimal data, which is always returned. For example, to request
						a list of records, with their classifications and files included with each returned record resource,
						a consumer typically performs a request like this:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /records HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: classifications, files
</pre>
					<p>
						It is also possible to further select the sub-resource's additional attributes in the same request.
						For example, if a consumer likes to select the children for each classification returned
						with each record, it is done in this way:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /records HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: classifications, files
select-classification: children
</pre>
					<p>
						The returned records collection resource contains records, each of which has the embedded files
						collection resource and the classifications collection resource with each classification's children
						collection embedded in the classification resource. All of this has been accomplished in a single
						request.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a possible recursion issue in this particular case, since the "children" sub-resource is
						also a collection of classifications, each of which can have "children" as a sub-resource, too, which
						could lead to an unexpected data overflow. To avoid this, a <a href="#concepts_selecting_advanced">limit</a>
						was introduced to return only the first level of recursive sub-resources.
					</p>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_subresource">Sub-resources</h4>
					<p>
						In case sub-resources are returned as linked resources of another parent resource, all of those
						sub-resources will have an additional attribute named "select-key". This parameter indicates that the
						sub-resource can be selected (embedded) in the parent resource representation. The value of the
						"select-key" parameter can be used as a value of the "select-&lt;parent-resource&gt;" parameter. For
						example, to get a record:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
</pre>
					<p>
						We can see there are numerous linked resources available for that record, which can be selected
						(embedded) in the returned record representation, using the specified "select-key" parameter:
					</p>
					<pre>
{
	"_links": {
		"self": {
			"href": "/record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e"
		},
		"fields": {
			"href": "/record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e/fields",
					<strong>"select-key": "fields"</strong>
		},
		"files": {
			"href": "/record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e/files",
					<strong>"select-key": "files"</strong>
		},
		...
	},
	"id": "250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e",
	"createdOn": "2015-05-15T10:41:19.51Z",
	"modifiedOn": "2015-06-12T11:13:15.433Z",
	"tag": null
}
</pre>
					<p>
						To request a record resource, with, for example, all the fields selected,
						look at the "fields" linked resource for the "<code>select-key</code>" parameter with the value "<code>fields</code>".
						This value means that you can include this sub-resource within the record resource just by specifying:
						"<code>select-record: fields</code>", when requesting the record next time, like this:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: fields
</pre>
					<p>
						This time you will get the fields embedded within the record resource instead of just
						returning a linked resource. This way you can dynamically change the amount of information
						returned for the same resource requested.
					</p>
					<p>
						For a more detailed example, see: <a href="resources/record.html#example-read">Reading a record</a>
					</p>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_attributes">Attributes</h4>
					<p>
						Next to the sub-resources, some resource attributes can also be selected (included
						or excluded from the requested resource representation). If not selected, these attributes will NOT be returned by default.
						This will be clearly indicated in the description of the property on the resource page.
					</p>
					<p>
						The listed attributes were either rarely used or the calculation of their value was too
						expensive to be included in the default representation of a resource, consequently, it was decided
						to hide these attributes unless a consumer specifically selects them.
					</p>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_namedfields">Explicit fields selection</h4>
					<p>
						When selecting the fields of a record, classification, user or file, it can be useful to
						select only certain fields, instead of having them all included in the returned resource.
						For example, to select fields of a record:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: fields
</pre>
					<p>
						This selects all the fields on that record. To filter out
						specific fields (or field groups), you can use additional header
						parameters that provide such filtering, like "<code>select-record-fields</code>" and
						"<code>select-record-fieldgroups</code>". The value for these parameters is a comma-separated list of
						fields/fieldgroups. Fields and field groups can be specified using their Ids (in the form of
						a GUID) or their names. Since the field/fieldgroup names can contain random text, it is
						advised to properly encode them using the
						<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">"Percent-Encoding"</a>
						so that they can safely pass over the network to the API server. Also take into
						account that the "comma" character needs to be escaped because it has a special
						meaning in the HTTP header values. This is an example of the selected
						fields' filtering feature:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: fields
select-record-fields: 295B1779-A381-4018-BE1D-B29E3458B41C, MyField, DummyField
select-record-fieldgroups: TestFieldGroup, CDE8E0C4-CD7E-47BC-93D3-0F54C7109FB6, FooBarGroup
</pre>
					<p>
						In the previous example there was no need to use the percent-encoding, but let's consider
						an example where escaping is required.The field "<code>My,Field,With,Commas</code>" contains a "comma" character in its name.
						To escape it properly, because in HTTP the header values represent the list of comma-separated values, and to avoid selecting fields with these names:
						<code>My</code>", "<code>Field</code>", "<code>With</code>" and "<code>Commas</code>", you need to percent-encode the field name so that the request reads as follows:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-record: fields
select-record-fields: My%2CField%2CWith%2CCommas
</pre>
					<p>
						This request will result in one field only, named
						"<code>My,Field,With,Commas</code>".
					</p>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_references">References in field values</h4>
					<p>
						For single and multiline text fields where the <b>AllowReferences</b> in field definition set to <code>true</code>
						in the field definition, you can return the resolved value of the reference instead of the explicit field value.
						Specify the "<code>select-field</code>" header with the value "<code>references</code>":
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /record/250d22a231ed4f0ba9afa49900b0252e HTTP/1.1
accept: application/hal+json
select-field: references
</pre>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_advanced">Advanced selecting and preventing recursion</h4>
					<p>
						The REST API will intelligently decide on whether or not to select a resource. Selecting is done based on the resource type. However, the number
						of times a resource is selected, is limited to prevent recursion. Without that limitation, querying for instance a user with <code>"Select-User: CreatedBy"</code>
						can lead to a recursive embedding loop where the selection is endlessy re-applied to the embedded resource.
					</p>
					<p>
						To remedy this, the API will preform selections in such a way that any resource type cannot occur more than two times in the path leading from the topmost resource
						to the leaves. For instance:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /user/{id} HTTP/1.1
select-user: createdby
</pre>
					<p>
						will return the <code>user</code>, and embed the <code>createdby</code>. The <code>select-user: createdby</code> will no longer be applied to the embedded <code>createdby</code> user, even though this too
						is a user resource. Similarly:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /classification/{id} HTTP/1.1
select-classification: parent, children
</pre>
					<p>
						will return the specified classification, and embed its parents and children. However, the children of the parent and the parent of the children will not be embedded.
						This also applies to deeper levels of nesting:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /user/{id} HTTP/1.1
select-user: fields
select-field: definition
select-fielddefinition: createdby
</pre>
					<p>
						will return the following 'tree' of embedded resources:
					</p>
					<pre>
user
	.field
		.definition
			.createdby
	.field
		.definition
			.createdby
</pre>
					<p>
						After the second occurrence of the <code>createdby</code> the embedding will stop, because the API will detect that <code>createdby</code> is of type user, which also appears higher up in the embedding tree.
					</p>
					<h4 id="concepts_selecting_nulls">Embedding/following relations that result in missing data</h4>
					<p>
						When a relation points to either of the following:
					</p>

			<section class="block block--details">
				<h3 id="usage_authentication">Authentication</h3>
				<div class="collapsable">
					<p>
						The ADAM REST API supports 4 modes of authentication: Basic, Integrated Windows Authentication
						(NTLM authentication), Bearer and Token-based authentication.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several endpoints in the ADAM REST API that do not require authentication.
						You can find them in the <a href="#usage_endpointheaders">Endpoint Requirements</a> section.
					</p>
					<p>
						The endpoint <code>/auth</code> accepts both GET and POST requests.
					</p>
					<p>
						All calls to <code>/auth</code> API endpoint will fail with a <code>401 Unauthorized</code>
						HTTP status code when not authenticated. The HTTP response will contain <code>WWW-Authenticate</code>
						HTTP headers identifying the supported modes of authentication:
					</p>
				<pre>
GET /auth HTTP/1.1

401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: NTLM, Token, Basic, Bearer
				</pre>
<pre>
POST /auth HTTP/1.1

401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: NTLM, Token, Basic, Bearer
</pre>
					<p>
						Note that for all other requests <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP headers will contain Token only.
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /records HTTP/1.1

401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Token
</pre>
					<p>
						At this point, the client must obtain the <a href="#usage_authentication_token">Token</a> in order to continue.
						In order to get the Token the client must use Basic, Windows or Bearer authentication on the <code>/auth</code>
						endpoint. The token will be returned in the response body and a Token header.
					</p>

					<h4 id="usage_authentication_basic">Basic authentication</h4>
					<p>
						When using Basic authentication, the client repeats the call to <code>/auth</code> endpoint, but this time adding an <code>Authorization</code>
						HTTP header parameter containing the Basic authentication credentials, as specified in the section named
						<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#section-2">"Basic Authentication Scheme"</a> of RFC 2617. The value of the
						parameter is the name of the authentication scheme (i.e. 'Basic'), followed by a single space character and followed by Base64-encoded text
						consisting of a user name and password, separated by a colon character (':').
						The client must also provide the <code>Registration</code> parameter containing the name of registration to log into.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the following example the user name is '<code>JohnDoe</code>' and the password is '<code>foobar</code>'.
						First, link the user name and password with the colon character to get '<code>JohnDoe:foobar</code>' (without quotes).
						Then Base64-encode it and get the text '<code>Sm9obkRvZTpmb29iYXI=</code>'.
						Finally, prefix everything with the scheme name ('<code>Basic</code>') to get the final text '<code>Basic Sm9obkRvZTpmb29iYXI=</code>'.
						Then perform the request, like in the following example:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /auth HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic Sm9obkRvZTpmb29iYXI=
Registration : adamnet

200 OK
Token: Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA==
{
	"message": "Authenticated.",
	"token": "Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA=="
}
</pre>

					<p>Same is for POST requests</p>
					<pre>
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic Sm9obkRvZTpmb29iYXI=
Registration : adamnet

200 OK
Token: Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA==
{
	"message": "Authenticated.",
	"token": "Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA=="
}
</pre>
					<h4 id="usage_authentication_ntlm">Integrated Windows authentication</h4>
					<p>
						When using Integrated Windows Authentication, the client repeats the call to <code>/auth</code> endpoint, but this time adding an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header
						providing NTLM authentication information.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>
							Because of the technical complexity of Windows integrated authentication, we do not provide an example here. If you want to connect to the
							REST API using Integrated Windows authentication, please refer to the documentation of your framework of choice to accomplish this.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Integrated Windows Authentication uses the <code>.activeDirectoryAuthenticationSettings</code> ADAM setting in the same way as ADAM Central does to specify the allowed Active Directory groups and Active Directory to ADAM group mappings.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use Integrated Windows Authentication from a .NET client, proceed as follows:
					</p>
					<pre>
var handler = new HttpClientHandler
{
	UseDefaultCredentials = true
};
var client = new HttpClient(handler);
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("API-VERSION", "1");
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "*/*");
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Registration", "adamnet");
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "MyClient");
var resp = client.GetAsync(uri);
</pre>

					<h4 id="usage_authentication_bearer">Bearer authentication</h4>
					<p>
						ADAM REST API also supports the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">Bearer authentication scheme</a>,
						used with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a>.
						When using Bearer token authentication, the client repeats the call to <code>/auth</code> endpoint,
						but this time adding an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header providing Bearer token, obtained from
						an external identity provider (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services">ADFS</a>).
						Within the bearer authentication scheme, JWT security tokens are used to authenticate users, just like
						the Basic or Windows authentication are.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use the Bearer authentication, your REST client first needs to obtain a JWT (JSON Web Token) from an external
						identity provider, which has been pre-configured in the <code>.bearerAuthenticationSettings</code> (from
						within the System studio). An example of a setting value that contains only one trusted issuer looks like this:
					</p>
					<pre>
&lt;settings version='2.0'&gt;
	&lt;trustedIssuers&gt;
		&lt;add name='localhost' thumbprint='4aada416bed8ce7faefc9b6fc4b2b98bf92d20d3' audience='all' enabled='true' label='Local ID provider'&gt;
			&lt;usernameClaim usernamePrefix='ADFS_user_'&gt;sub&lt;/usernameClaim&gt;
			&lt;emailClaim&gt;email&lt;/emailClaim&gt;
			&lt;groupMappings&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='email' claimValue='voicu@gmail.com' adamGroup='Administrators' /&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='email' claimValue='mike@gmail.com' adamGroup='Users' /&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='email' adamGroup='Everyone' /&gt;
			&lt;/groupMappings&gt;
		&lt;/add&gt;
	&lt;/trustedIssuers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
</pre>
					<p>
						This will configure a trusted issuer, with its name, certificate thumbprint, etc. The following parameters
						are available to be customized:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>name</b> - this parameter will be matched against the '<b>iss</b>' (issuer) claim in the JWT
								security tokens, received from clients' authentication requests, to identify the security token service
								(STS) that has issued the claim.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>thumbprint</b> - used to locate the locally stored digital certificate, which will be used to verify
								the authenticity of incoming JWT security tokens claiming to be from that issuer.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>audience</b> - an optional parameter used to specify which audience we (the REST API) belong to.
								If the incoming JWT security tokens, in their list of intended audiences, don't contain our audience
								specifier, it means those requests were not meant for our REST API and will be happily ignored. If this
								parameter is not specified, all the requests will be accepted.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>usernameClaim</b> - specifies which claim, from the incoming JWT security tokens, represents a valid
								username identifier of users, which is needed to uniquely identify each user.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>emailClaim</b> - specifies which claim, from the incoming JWT security tokens, represents a valid
								user's e-mail address, which will be used to update the existing user's e-mail address in ADAM or will
								be used when a new user is about to be created in ADAM.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>usernamePrefix</b> - an optional parameter that specifies which prefix to add to the claimed username
								when creating a new user in ADAM. If it's not specified then new ADAM users will be created without any
								prefix, only using their claimed usernames. If you later decide to change this parameter, you'll need to
								update all the existing users in ADAM, to update all the usernames with previous prefix to a new prefix,
								in order to properly identify those users again, once the prefix has changed.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>groupMappings</b> - used to specify which users should be mapped to which ADAM groups. The value of
								this parameter represents a list of mappings that specify which claim (parameter <b>claimName</b>)
								should be examined to see if its incoming value matches the specified value (parameter <b>claimValue</b>)
								and if the values match, a user will be granted the membership to the specified ADAM group (parameter
								<b>adamGroup</b>), if he already isn't a member of that group.<br/>

								The list of all the unique ADAM groups, specified within those group mappings, represents the set of
								all the <b>allowed ADAM groups</b>, which incoming users can potentially be granted memberships to.
								Once all the mappings are analyzed, for a single request, and the list of <b>granted ADAM groups</b>
								is formed, all the other allowed groups, not present in the granted list, will form the opposite list
								of ADAM groups which a user is supposed to be removed from.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is an example of a valid JWT security token:
						<code>eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6ImhUa041UFRMd2dCMFgtLXBsSUc3SUsxVHRMTSJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ2b2ljdSIsImVtYWlsIjoidm9pY3VAZ21haWwuY29tIiwicm9sZSI6WyJ0ZXN0IDIiLCJBZG1pbiJdLCJpc3MiOiJsb2NhbGhvc3QiLCJhdWQiOiJhbGwiLCJleHAiOjE0NjY2NjEyNzMsIm5iZiI6MTQ2NjY2MTA5M30.Q5xavOKxfKwjPu_lLh6fy_9azpYG7M4QwJg3oSuUoceVrpe9hdWBb4_3a4RAEx9n6wGA3MAHajfAfocg7bgIQGxsgmdXOmKq1xTg14yhVSAKiwz0kV0JJFdNc6RogjN9bRG8oXaCvh_1YIw-k7MkAocKzTLtC-GlyysVKhpIX7Blj0duZEq1bwM8qrkFSbD-0ma80PR7vZv1PH-cPHtrhLBNPj2HvLwrfCack_N3X8Ilt91p6p7jW77XJvsk26mywtcJb9OJgTZo424d4sKUJdIgG-zBud2KaxRkGWMSfrSrCllk7rjxvsp7PeChIXeJKHxCsIlQJo5G30vTjrzpAg</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is that same token base64-decoded:
					</p>
					<pre>
{
	"typ": "JWT",
	"alg": "RS256",
	"x5t": "hTkN5PTLwgB0X--plIG7IK1TtLM"
}
.
{
	"sub": "voicu",
	"email": "voicu@gmail.com",
	"role": ["test 2", "Admin"],
	"iss": "localhost",
	"aud": "all",
	"exp": 1466661273,
	"nbf": 1466661093
}
.
[signature]
</pre>
					<p>
						For such a JWT security token, it would be reasonable to expect that '.bearerAuthenticationSetting'
						would look something like this:
					</p>
					<pre>
&lt;settings version='2.0'&gt;
	&lt;trustedIssuers&gt;
		&lt;add name='...' thumbprint='...' enabled='true' label='...'&gt;
			&lt;usernameClaim&gt;sub&lt;/usernameClaim&gt;
			&lt;emailClaim&gt;email&lt;/emailClaim&gt;
			&lt;groupMappings&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='role' claimValue='Admin' adamGroup='Administrators' /&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='role' claimValue='User' adamGroup='Users' /&gt;
				&lt;add claimName='sub' adamGroup='Everyone' /&gt;
			&lt;/groupMappings&gt;
		&lt;/add&gt;
	&lt;/trustedIssuers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
</pre>
					<p>
						The setting says that the incoming JWT security tokens should contain a claim named 'sub'
						which represents an incoming user's username identity. Also, tokens should contain a claim
						named 'email' which represents an incoming user's e-mail address. We didn't specify neither
						the 'audience' nor 'usernamePrefix', which means we accept all the tokens, issued by a
						certain identity provider and we will not add any prefixes to usernames when creating new
						users in ADAM.<br/>

						For a given example request above, our group mappings will grant that user a membership to
						the ADAM groups <b>Administrators</b> and <b>Everyone</b>, but it will remove that user
						from ADAM group <b>Users</b>, because the incoming request doesn't contain any claims
						that match that group mapping.<br/>

						Also, note that the last group mapping doesn't have the <b>claimValue</b> parameter
						specified. It basically means that all the incoming user requests, which contain a 'sub'
						claim present, regardless of its value, will have those users added to the group 'Everyone'.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a user exists in the external identity provider database (e.g. ADFS), but not in ADAM,
						a new ADAM user will be automatically created and assigned to the claimed groups.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once a user is successfully authenticated to ADAM, the reponse will contain
						an ADAM session token, which can then be used to access all of the authorized
						REST API resources.

					<h4 id="usage_authentication_token">Token-based authentication</h4>
					<p>
						For token-based authentication, the client must have authenticated successfully with
						Basic/Windows authentication schemes to receive a token from the server. If you have a
						token from a previous request, you have to add an <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header
						containing word '<code>Token</code>' followed by empty space and actual token:
					</p>
					<pre>
GET /records HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token Y2ZkZDdjZTc2NDdmNDBlOWE5NDI2ZDhjNjY2MDRhMTU6QURBTU5FVA==
200 OK
&lt;content&gt;
</pre>
					<p>
						In token-based authentication, the token is a Base64-encoded ADAM session identifier, followed by a colon and a registration name. The token will be valid as long as the ADAM session
						associated with it is valid (this validity is determined by the ADAM settings). If you already have an ADAM session identifier from a previous request or from
						a different application, you can use that to authenticate using token-based authentication.

					<h4 id="usage_authentication_takeoversession">Taking session over</h4>
					<p>
						Under a Corporate licence model any user can have only single session. Similar limitations apply when ADAM is in Grace period meaning that the license has not been activated yet.
						Consult the ADAM Installation Guide for further information on licensing models.
						When user tries to login for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time, the request, even when completely correct, is rejected with <code>SessionInUse</code> message.
						If you want to take over the session that was previously created — you will have to add the TakeOverSession header to the authentication request.
					</p>
					<p>
					<code>TakeOverSession</code> (optional, boolean): add this header to take over an open session of the user identified by your authentication request.
						See usage in <a href="#usage_authentication_example">complete authentication example</a>. Logging in with <code>TakeOverSession</code> header closes
						the previous session, effectively rendering the previous session id obsolete and logs the user in generating a new session id (and token).
						See <a href="#usage_authentication_token">Token authentication</a> for details on sessionId-based login if you want to reuse the session instead of taking it over.
					</p>
					<p>
						The default header value is False. The header is only relevant and should only be used in case of a Corporate license or in Grace period.
					</p>
					<h4 id="usage_authentication_logout">Logout</h4>
					<p>
						In order to invalidate the current credentials and log the current user out, perform a standard HTTP DELETE request to the <code>/auth</code> API endpoint.

						resource, you need to perform a <code>POST</code> request on a collection to which you want to add a new
						resource. Performing a <code>PUT</code> request updates an existing resource and issuing a <code>DELETE</code>
						request deletes an existing resource. You need to have appropriate privileges in order
						to perform these requests.
					</p>
					<p>
						In most cases, you can reuse the response (in application/json format) of the read operation to
						provide that response as a request body for the edit requests.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, in most cases, setting a resource's property to null resets its value (like "tag" for example).
					</p>
					<p>
						For changing the nested collections, you can use <code>addOrUpdate</code> and <code>remove</code> sections in the collections request,
						which contain id's of elements which have to be added/updated (removed) in (from) nested collections.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each resource contains the "Examples" section on its documentation page, which provides more
						info on how to properly perform editing requests on that resource.

					<div>
						Each file that you upload through this API can be added to a record.
						Also, do note that each uploaded file can be used only once.
						After the uploaded file has been used it gets deleted from the upload storage location.
						The physical limitation of the file size in some file systems (like FAT32) makes it difficult
						to upload files larger than 4 GB and that's the reason this API implements 2 approaches to
						upload files. One for the small files (smaller than 4 GB) and the other one for big files
						(larger than 4GB).
					</div>
					<h4 id="usage_uploading_lt4g">Uploading files below 4 GB</h4>

						<p>
							Uploading a file through the ADAM REST API is done in the following way:
						</p>
						<pre>
POST /uploads HTTP/1.1
</pre>
						<p>
							".RoleExecuteMaintenanceJobs" and ".RoleViewMaintenanceJobs" privileges are required for users that want to upload files, due to the internal implementation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Right now only multipart form-data content-type is supported. This means that you cannot simply <code>POST</code> binary stream
							to <code>/uploads</code> endpoint. Instead, you produce proper multipart form-data request. However, multipart form-data is
							the default format for modern HTTP clients, so crafting such a request should not be a problem. The multipart form-data
							request looks similar to this:
						</p>
						<pre>
POST /uploads HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 244947
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) ...
api-version: 1

[binary content]
</pre>
						<p>
							Currently only one file per request is supported, even though the format allows the multi-upload.
						</p>
						<p>
							When successful, either a HTTP 200 OK response is returned, or a HTTP 202 Accepted response.
							If the response is 200 OK, it contains a file upload token which can then be used in e.g. the edit record file request.
						</p>
						<pre>
{
	"token":"NzVmMDY5YTA4MGU1NDBhMDkyY2FmYzQ3YzQwMzNjMmQ="

					<p><b>Some remarks:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Searching for records/classifications using a search expression is done in 2 steps: first ElasticSearch is queried to get a list of matching IDs, then those IDs are used to query the ADAM database.<br />
							If any of the search results is deleted between step 1 and 2, the TotalCount value will be out of sync with the real count of search results.<br />
							If a property or field value of those objects is changed between step 1 and 2, the retrieved facet count related to that property or field will be out of sync with the real count.
						</li>
						<li>Facet values with a count of 0 are omitted from the reply, even if they are directly specified, e.g. as explicit values. If the consuming application needs to display facet values with a count of 0, it should keep track of them internally.</li>

										<b>NOTE:</b> search logging stores the “origin” parameter and it is read by REST API from <code>REFERER</code> header.<br />
										If it's not specified in the request from the custom applications/services, the REST API will use the <code>USER-AGENT</code> header to fill the "origin". The "origin" may be used to distinguish several search sources within the same application or several applications/services.<br />
										<b>NOTE:</b> Search logging is also controlled by the .enterpriseSearchActionsToLog and .enterpriseSearchLogDetail settings in ADAM. See the ADAM Administrator Guide for more information.
